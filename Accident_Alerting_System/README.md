# Car Speed Monitor

This project is designed to monitor the speed of a car and send an SMS alert if the speed drops suddenly by more than 40 kmph. It leverages the Twilio API for sending SMS notifications, the IPinfo API to retrieve the address based on the device's public IP address, and the OpenCage API to get the geographical coordinates of the location.

## Features

- **Real-time Speed Monitoring**: Continuously monitors the speed of the car.
- **Sudden Speed Drop Detection**: Sends an alert if the speed drops by more than 40 kmph.
- **Location Retrieval**: Retrieves the current location of the device based on its IP address.
- **SMS Notification**: Sends an SMS with the alert and location details.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Twilio account with a verified phone number
- API keys for the following services:
  - [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/)
  - [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/)
